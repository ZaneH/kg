Here you'll find my knowledge gardens. It's a bit of an experiment after reading about the Zettelkasten method. How cool would it be to have a place to store all of your knowledge and be able to easily find it again? I'm hoping this will be that place.

A lot of my time is spent growing the [[code/code-garden|Code Garden]]. I'm excited to see what gardens will grow next.
