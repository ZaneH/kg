```bash
$ python3 -m pip install --user -U pipx
$ pipx install posting
$ posting
```

This is the recommended way to install [darrenburns/posting](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting)
which is a really nice Postman alternative. I don't think they'll be adding a sign-in requirement
to the CLI version. It's nice to see there's a standardized format for requests and there's an
idea of "collections" in posting.
