## What is Language Feel?

There is a certain [feel](https://youtu.be/lvKQh3Od6V4?si=7PNpY9UM0UNhyBtx&t=1339) to every programming language. Its syntax, idioms, libraries, error handling, etc. all create a unique feel to each language.

When I open a JavaScript codebase I'm expecting to feel C-like code with some OOP sprinkled in. It's likely the only time I see `===` in code. I'm also expecting heavy reliance on libraries and lots of try/catches. When I open a Ruby project I'm expecting an HTML-like syntax with emphasis on functional programming, less error handling, and plenty of libraries. The Ruby project will read more like English and has more "syntax sugar."

### Why is Language Feel Important?

This feel is unique for most languages and the languages I continuously use are ones that have a good feel to them. The ones I advocate for are also the ones that have a good feel to them. Some of my favorites: Dockerfiles, Go and Objective-C. JavaScript didn't make the list because it's a bit too quirky.

## What Makes a Good Language Feel?

- Sensible syntax
- Less footguns (give example of GitHub's `${{ }}` syntax)
    - Maybe include a Solidity example?
- Bring the features people like in a prev ecosystem to a new one
- `type`in Python, `typeof` in C, `type` in JavaScript
    - "type" as a variable name in Python is a footgun
