## What is Language Feel?

I don't know if everyone has this experience, but in my opinion there is a "feel" to every programming language. Its syntax, idioms, libraries, error handling, etc. all create a unique feel to each language.

When I open a JavaScript codebase I'm expecting to feel C-like code with some OOP sprinkled in. It's likely the only time I see `===` in code. I'm also expecting heavy reliance on libraries and lots of try/catches. When I open a Ruby project I'm expecting an HTML-like syntax with emphasis on functional programming, less error handling, and plenty of libraries. The Ruby project will read more like English and has more "syntax sugar."

### Why is Language Feel Important?

This feel is unique for most languages and the languages I continuously use are ones that have a good feel to them. The ones I advocate for are also the ones that have a good feel to them. Some of my favorites: Dockerfiles, Rust, and Elixir. JavaScript didn't make the list because it's too quirky. Python didn't make the list because it relies on proper spacing. Go didn't make the list likely because I haven't used it enough.

## What Makes a Good Language Feel?

TODO: Flesh this out more

- Sensible syntax
- Less footguns (give example of GitHubs `${{ }}` syntax)
    - Maybe include a Solidity example?
- Bring the features people like in a prev ecosystem to a new one
