title: Learning Huff
---

Huff is a new language that compiles to EVM bytecode. It's like writing assembly, but with a few more features. I'm learning Huff to better understand the EVM and how to write [[mev/garden|MEV bots]].

## Initial Thoughts

- It's like writing raw opcodes, this is pretty fun.
- The tooling seems good enough for now.
