title: Learning Huff
---

Huff is a new language that compiles to EVM bytecode. It's like writing assembly, but with a few more features. I'm learning Huff to better understand the EVM and how to write [[mev/garden|MEV bots]].

## Initial Thoughts

- It's like writing raw opcodes, this is pretty fun.
- The tooling seems good enough for now.
- The [Seaport](https://docs.huff.sh/tutorial/hello-world/#advanced-topic-the-seaport-method-of-returning-strings) method of returning strings took me about 3 days to start to understand.
- By going through the [Huff Puzzles](https://github.com/RareSkills/huff-puzzles), I'm starting to get a better understanding of EVM overall. It has given me a greater appreciation for it.
