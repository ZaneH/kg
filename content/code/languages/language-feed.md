## What is Language Feel?

I don't know if everyone has this experience, but in my opinion there is a "feel" to every programming language. Its syntax, idioms, libraries, error handling, etc. all create a unique feel to each language.

When I open a JavaScript codebase I'm expecting to feel C-like code with some OOP sprinkled in. It's likely the only time I see `===` in code. I'm also expecting heavy reliance on libraries and lots of try/catches. When I open a Ruby project I'm expecting an HTML-like syntax with emphasis on functional programming, less error handling, and plenty of libraries.

This feel is unique for most languages and the languages I continuously use are ones that have a good feel to them.
