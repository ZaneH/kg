## Motivation

The motivation for learning Rust was slow to develop. There isn't really a reason I'd use Rust over another language until now. I've been interested in [[mev/garden|MEV bots]] the last few years and it's clear that Rust is the language of choice for the pros. Now that I have time to dive in, I'm excited to learn more about the language and the ecosystem.

## Initial Thoughts

- **08/26/23** The compile times are a bit annoying.
- The `Result<...>` pattern matching is very similar to Elixir.
    - `.unwrap()` is starting to make sense.
- The error messages are very helpful once you can parse them.
- Understanding the `Ok(())` syntax was useful.
- `tokio` was intimidating at first, but it's not so bad.
- I learned how to use `Mutex`. `Arc` is something I learned from [iOS](code/overview/mobile-programming).
- Starting to understand the build system + cargo. It's nice.
- [The Dev Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGh-0cMvH5g&list=PLAJ-sYO1aGdxQ_skPPtJ7PlSAjTXM-atv) has a good playlist on Rust. It's definitely helping my understanding.
- **09/17/23** - I'm learning to use [Diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) next. Writing to a local SQLite database will be useful for some things I'm working on.
    - Also trying to understand when to use traits & enums.
    - Gave up on this project, writing SQL migrations with Rust is not fun!
