title: Learning Rust

## Motivation

The motivation for learning Rust was slow to develop. There isn't really a reason I'd use Rust over another language until now. I've been interested in [[mev/mev-garden|MEV bots]] the last few years and it's clear that Rust is the language of choice for the pros. Now that I have time to dive in, I'm excited to learn more about the language and the ecosystem.

## Initial Thoughts

- The compile times are a bit annoying.
- The `Result<...>` pattern matching is very similar to Elixir.
    - `.unwrap()` is starting to make sense.
- The error messages are very helpful once you can parse them.
- Understand the `Ok(())` syntax was useful.
- `tokio` was intimidating at first, but it's not that bad.
- I still don't fully understand `Mutex`, but my iOS background taught me about `Arc`.
- Starting to understand the build system + cargo. It's nice.
