Linux is one of the top 3 Desktop operating systems after Windows and macOS. In recent years it has grown in
popularity for a number of reasons. I think the start of mainstream Linux adoption is when Steam released
Proton, a software layer for bringing many popular Windows games onto Linux.

This was no small task, but it was made possible by the open-source nature of Linux.

## Which Linux to Choose?

There's *a lot* of different Linux "distros" to choose from. Each has their own niche. Ultimately, it's
personal preference and depends on what your needs are, but Ubuntu is a great place to start. It looks
very familiar for anyone new to Linux, it's easy to install, and it's pretty reliable.
