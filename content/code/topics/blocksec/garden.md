## Thoughts While Practicing

- [[code/topics/blocksec/solidity-quirks|Solidity Quirks]]
- Day 4: I'm getting familiar with all of the tools. With my current knowledge, I'll only be able to spot very specific bugs. I need to broaden my knowledge and read more code. I'm also realizing math will be an important skill in this field.
    - Finding interesting contracts to analyze takes time. Some kind of parser would be nice.
        - Reading through "internal transactions" is a good start.
        - GitHub has also been an ok source.
- [[code/topics/blocksec/fuzzing|Fuzzing]] has been helpful and fun.
- [[code/topics/blocksec/ethersjs|Ethers.js]] is not my first choice, but it's popular. Damn Vulnerable DeFi taught me a lot about Ethers.js.
- Day 14: Seems like everyone working in the space is pretty anonymous... I may end up doing the same.
