## Reacquanting with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered applications. Initially it earned a spot in my toolbelt because it was the easiest way to get started with server-side rendering in React. But as the ecosystem has evolved, Next.js has become a powerful tool for building full-stack applications.

During that transition, I focused on other tools, and now it looks like Next.js has become an oppinionated framework for fast and scalable applications. I'm excited to see how it goes.

To get reaquainted with Next.js will take some time, but their [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) is a great place to start. With their latest updates, they've added diagrams to the documentation which makes it easier to understand how everything fits together.
